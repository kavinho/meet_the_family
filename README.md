# The Problem
 Our problem is set on the planet of Lengaburu, the distant galaxy of Tara B. Our protagonists are King Arthur, Queen Margaret and their family.

 King Arthur is the emperor of Lengaburu and has been ruling the planet for the last 350 years (they have long lives in Lengaburu!). Let’s write some code to get to know the family.

Write code to model out the King Arthur family tree so that:
 Given a ‘name’ and a ‘relationship’, you should output the people corresponding to the relationship
in the order in which they are added to the family tree
 You should be able to add a child to any family in the tree through the mother

## Assumptions:
  - Names are unique
## TODOS:
    - Complete  unit tests: I didnt not go through testing all components, and negative bad data test, it would hae taken too much time.

## Prerequisites:
Given that, I have tested this project on OSX, here are the requirements:
 - python 3.8.2

## SETUP
The following will install virtual-env called env, install required packages and, runs tests:
```bash
./srtup.sh
 ```

 ## RUN
